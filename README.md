Our Commitments to Loving-Kindness and Integrity
================================================

David Richo
-----------

* I do my best
  to keep my word,
  honor commitments,
  and follor through
  on the tasks I agree to.

* I am making every effort
  to abide by standards
  of rigorous honesty and respect
  in all my dealings
  no matter how others act toward me.
 
* I forego taking advantage of anyone
  because of his or her ignorance,
  misfortune, or financial straits.
  My question is not
  "What can I get away with?"
  but "What is the right thing to do?"
  If I fall down in this,
  I can admit it, make amends,
  and resolve to act differently next time.
  Now I apologize more easily and willingly
  when necessary.

* If someone is overly generous toward me
  or has an exaggerated sense of obligation to me,
  I do not want to exploit
  his or her lack of boundaries.
  Instead, I want to express appreciation
  and work out an equitable way of interacting.

* I keep examining my conscience with true candor.
  I take searching inventories
  not only about how I may have harmed others,
  but also about how I may not have activated my potentials
  or shared my gifts,
  how I may still be holding on to prejudices
  or the will to retaliate,
  how I may still not be
  as loving, inclusive, and open
  as I can be.

* I welcome feedback
  that shows me where I am less caring,
  where less tolerant,
  where less open about my real feelings
  than I can be.
  When I am shown up as a pretender
  or called on being mean or inauthentic,
  I am not defensive
  but take it as information
  about what I have to work on.
  I appreciate positive feedback also.

* I am letting go of the need
  to keep up appearances or to project
  a false or overly-impressive self-image.
  Now I want to appear as I am,
  without pretense
  and no matter how unflattering.
  I do not want to use any charms
  of body, word or mind
  to trick or deceive others.
  Being loved for who I am
  has become more important
  – and more interesting –
  than upholding the ever-shaky status
  of my ego.

* I now measure my success
  by how much steadfast love I have,
  not by how much I have in the bank,
  how much I achieve in business,
  how much status I have attained,
  or how much power I have over others.
  The central
  – and most exhilarating –
  focus of my life
  is to show all my love
  in the style that is uniquely mine,
  in every way I can,
  here and now,
  always and everywhere,
  no one excluded.

* As I say yes
  to the reality of who I am,
  with pride in my gifts
  and unabashed awareness of my limits,
  I notice that I can love myself
  and that I become more lovable too.

* I never give up on believing
  that everyone has an innate goodness
  and that being open
  can contribute to bringing it out.

* I am learning to trust others
  when the record shows they can be trusted
  while I, nonetheless,
  commit myself to being trustworthy
  regardless of what others may do.
  I am always open to rebuilding trust
  when it has been broken,
  if the other person is willing.

* I remain open to reconcile
  with others after conflict.
  At the same time,
  I am learning to release
  – with love and without blame –
  those who show themselves to be unwilling
  to relate to me respectfully.
  I accept the given
  of sudden unexplained silence
  or rejection by others
  and will never use that style myself.

* I am learning to be assertive
  by asking for what I need
  without fear or inhibition.
  I ask without demand,
  expectation,
  manipulation,
  or a sense of entitlement.
  I can show respect
  for the timing and choices of others
  by being able to take no for an answer.

* I do not knowingly hurt
  or intend to offend others.
  I act kindly toward others
  not to impress or oblige them
  but because I really am kind
  – or working on it.
  If others fail to thank me
  or to return my kindness,
  that does not have to stop me
  from behaving lovingly nonetheless.

* If people hurt me,
  I can say "Ouch!"
  and ask to open a dialogue.
  I may ask for amends
  but I can drop the topic
  if they are not forthcoming.
  No matter what,
  I do not choose to get even,
  hold grudges,
  keep a record of wrongs,
  or hate anyone.
  "What goes around comes around"
  has become "May what goes around come around
  in a way that helps him or her learn and grow."
  I am thereby hoping
  for the transformation of others
  rather than retribution against them.

* I do not gloat
  over the sufferings or defeats
  of those who have hurt me.
  "It serves them right!"
  has changed to: "May this serve
  to help them evolve."

* I am practicing ways to express
  my anger against unfairness
  directly and nonviolently
  rather than in abusive,
  bullying,
  threatening,
  blaming,
  out-of-control,
  or passive ways.

* I do not let others abuse me
  but I want to interpret their harshness
  as coming from their own pain
  and as a sadly confused way of letting me know
  they need connection
  but don't know how to ask for it
  in healthy ways.
  I recognize this with concern
  not with censure or scorn.

* I have a sense of humor
  but not at the expense of others.
  I want to use humor
  to poke fun at human foibles,
  especially my own.
  I do not engage in ridicule,
  put-downs,
  taunting,
  teasing,
  barbs,
  snide or bigoted remarks,
  sarcasm or "comebacks."
  When others use hurtful humor toward me
  I want to feel the pain in both of us
  and look for ways
  to bring more mutual respect
  into our communication.

* I do not laugh at people
  or at their mistakes and misfortunes
  but look for ways to be supportive.

* I notice how in some groups there are people
  who are humiliated or excluded.
  Rather than be comforted
  that I am still safely an insider,
  especially by gossiping about them,
  I want to sense the pain
  in being an outsider.
  Then I can reach out and include everyone
  in my circle of love, compassion and respect.
