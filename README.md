Our Commitments to Loving-Kindness and Integrity
================================================

David Richo
-----------

* I do my best
  to keep my word,
  honor commitments,
  and follor through
  on the tasks I agree to.

* I am making every effort
  to abide by standards
  of rigorous honesty and respect
  in all my dealings
  no matter how others act toward me.
 
* I forego taking advantage of anyone
  because of his or her ignorance,
  misfortune, or financial straits.
  My question is not
  "What can I get away with?"
  but "What is the right thing to do?"
  If I fall down in this,
  I can admit it, make amends,
  and resolve to act differently next time.
  Now I apologize more easily and willingly
  when necessary.

* If someone is overly generous toward me
  or has an exaggerated sense of obligation to me,
  I do not want to exploit
  his or her lack of boundaries.
  Instead, I want to express appreciation
  and work out an equitable way of interacting.

* I keep examining my conscience with true candor.
  I take searching inventories
  not only about how I may have harmed others,
  but also about how I may not have activated my potentials
  or shared my gifts,
  how I may still be holding on to prejudices
  or the will to retaliate,
  how I may still not be
  as loving, inclusive, and open
  as I can be.

* I welcome feedback
  that shows me where I am less caring,
  where less tolerant,
  where less open about my real feelings
  than I can be.
  When I am shown up as a pretender
  or called on being mean or inauthentic,
  I am not defensive
  but take it as information
  about what I have to work on.
  I appreciate positive feedback also.

* I am letting go of the need
  to keep up appearances or to project
  a false or overly-impressive self-image.
  Now I want to appear as I am,
  without pretense
  and no matter how unflattering.
  I do not want to use any charms
  of body, word or mind
  to trick or deceive others.
  Being loved for who I am
  has become more important
  – and more interesting –
  than upholding the ever-shaky status
  of my ego.

* I now measure my success
  by how much steadfast love I have,
  not by how much I have in the bank,
  how much I achieve in business,
  how much status I have attained,
  or how much power I have over others.
  The central
  – and most exhilarating –
  focus of my life
  is to show all my love
  in the style that is uniquely mine,
  in every way I can,
  here and now,
  always and everywhere,
  no one excluded.

* As I say yes
  to the reality of who I am,
  with pride in my gifts
  and unabashed awareness of my limits,
  I notice that I can love myself
  and that I become more lovable too.

* I never give up on believing
  that everyone has an innate goodness
  and that being open
  can contribute to bringing it out.

* I am learning to trust others
  when the record shows they can be trusted
  while I, nonetheless,
  commit myself to being trustworthy
  regardless of what others may do.
  I am always open to rebuilding trust
  when it has been broken,
  if the other person is willing.

* I remain open to reconcile
  with others after conflict.
  At the same time,
  I am learning to release
  – with love and without blame –
  those who show themselves to be unwilling
  to relate to me respectfully.
  I accept the given
  of sudden unexplained silence
  or rejection by others
  and will never use that style myself.

* I am learning to be assertive
  by asking for what I need
  without fear or inhibition.
  I ask without demand,
  expectation,
  manipulation,
  or a sense of entitlement.
  I can show respect
  for the timing and choices of others
  by being able to take no for an answer.

* I do not knowingly hurt
  or intend to offend others.
  I act kindly toward others
  not to impress or oblige them
  but because I really am kind
  – or working on it.
  If others fail to thank me
  or to return my kindness,
  that does not have to stop me
  from behaving lovingly nonetheless.

* If people hurt me,
  I can say "Ouch!"
  and ask to open a dialogue.
  I may ask for amends
  but I can drop the topic
  if they are not forthcoming.
  No matter what,
  I do not choose to get even,
  hold grudges,
  keep a record of wrongs,
  or hate anyone.
  "What goes around comes around"
  has become "May what goes around come around
  in a way that helps him or her learn and grow."
  I am thereby hoping
  for the transformation of others
  rather than retribution against them.

* I do not gloat
  over the sufferings or defeats
  of those who have hurt me.
  "It serves them right!"
  has changed to: "May this serve
  to help them evolve."

* I am practicing ways to express
  my anger against unfairness
  directly and nonviolently
  rather than in abusive,
  bullying,
  threatening,
  blaming,
  out-of-control,
  or passive ways.

* I do not let others abuse me
  but I want to interpret their harshness
  as coming from their own pain
  and as a sadly confused way of letting me know
  they need connection
  but don't know how to ask for it
  in healthy ways.
  I recognize this with concern
  not with censure or scorn.

* I have a sense of humor
  but not at the expense of others.
  I want to use humor
  to poke fun at human foibles,
  especially my own.
  I do not engage in ridicule,
  put-downs,
  taunting,
  teasing,
  barbs,
  snide or bigoted remarks,
  sarcasm or "comebacks."
  When others use hurtful humor toward me
  I want to feel the pain in both of us
  and look for ways
  to bring more mutual respect
  into our communication.

* I do not laugh at people
  or at their mistakes and misfortunes
  but look for ways to be supportive.

* I notice how in some groups there are people
  who are humiliated or excluded.
  Rather than be comforted
  that I am still safely an insider,
  especially by gossiping about them,
  I want to sense the pain
  in being an outsider.
  Then I can reach out and include everyone
  in my circle of love, compassion and respect.

* I look at other people and their choices
  with intelligent discernment
  but without censure.
  I still notice
  the shortcomings of others and myself,
  but now I am beginning to see them
  as facts to deal with
  rather than flaws to be criticized or be ashamed of.
  Accepting others as they are
  has become more important
  than whether they are
  what I want them to be.

* I avoid Criticizing, Interfering, or giving Advice
  that is not specifically asked for.
  I take care of myself
  by staying away from those
  who use this CIA approach toward me,
  while still holding them in my spiritual circle
  of loving-kindness.

* I am willing to participate
  in the harmless conventions and social rituals
  that make others happy,
  for example, family dinners
  or acknowledgement of birthdays.
  When a situation becomes toxic,
  I excuse myself without rancor.

* I am less and less competitive
  in relationships at home and work
  and find happiness in cooperation and community.
  I shun situations in which my winning
  means that others lose in a humiliating way.

* In intimate bonds,
  I honor equality,
  keep agreements,
  work on problems,
  and act in respectful and trustworthy ways.
  My goal is not to use a relationship to gratify my ego
  but to dispossess myself of ego to gratify the relationship.
  Also, I respect the bounradies of others' relationships.

* I want my sexual style to adhere to the same standards
  of integrity and loving-kindness
  that apply in all areas of my life.
  More and more,
  my sexuality expresses love,
  passion, and joyful playfulness.
  I remain committed
  to a responsible adult style
  of relating and enjoying.

* Confronted with the suffering in the world,
  I do not turn my eyes away,
  nor do I get stuck in blaming God or humanity
  but simply ask:
  "What then shall _I_ do?
  What is the opportuniry in this
  for my practice of loving-kindness?"
  I keep finding ways to respond
  even if they have to be minimal:
  "It is better to light one candle
  than to curse the darkness."

* I want my caring concern
  to extend to the world around me.
  I am committing myself
  to fighting injustice
  in nonviolent ways.
  I support restorative
  rather than retributive justice.
  I am distressed
  and feel myself called to action
  by violations of human rights,
  nuclear armaments,
  economic and racial injustice.
  I tread with care on the Earth
  with what St. Bonaventure called,
  "a courtesy toward natural things."

* I appreciate
  that whatever love or wisdom I may have or show
  comes not from me
  but through me.
  I give thanks
  for these encouraging graces
  and say yes to the stirring call
  to live up to them.

* I am not hard on myself when I fail
  to live up to these ideals.
  I just keep practicing earnestly.
  The sincerity of my intention
  and my ongoing efforts
  feel like the equivalent of success.

* I do not think
  I am above other people
  because I honor this list.
  I do not demand
  that others follow it.
