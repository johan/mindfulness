Our Commitments to Loving-Kindness and Integrity
================================================

David Richo
-----------

* I do my best
  to keep my word,
  honor commitments,
  and follor through
  on the tasks I agree to.

* I am making every effort
  to abide by standards
  of rigorous honesty and respect
  in all my dealings
  no matter how others act toward me.
 
* I forego taking advantage of anyone
  because of his or her ignorance,
  misfortune, or financial straits.
  My question is not
  "What can I get away with?"
  but "What is the right thing to do?"
  If I fall down in this,
  I can admit it, make amends,
  and resolve to act differently next time.
  Now I apologize more easily and willingly
  when necessary.

* If someone is overly generous toward me
  or has an exaggerated sense of obligation to me,
  I do not want to exploit
  his or her lack of boundaries.
  Instead, I want to express appreciation
  and work out an equitable way of interacting.
