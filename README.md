Our Commitments to Loving-Kindness and Integrity
================================================

David Richo
-----------

* I do my best
  to keep my word,
  honor commitments,
  and follor through
  on the tasks I agree to.

* I am making every effort
  to abide by standards
  of rigorous honesty and respect
  in all my dealings
  no matter how others act toward me.
 
* I forego taking advantage of anyone
  because of his or her ignorance,
  misfortune, or financial straits.
  My question is not
  "What can I get away with?"
  but "What is the right thing to do?"
  If I fall down in this,
  I can admit it, make amends,
  and resolve to act differently next time.
  Now I apologize more easily and willingly
  when necessary.

* If someone is overly generous toward me
  or has an exaggerated sense of obligation to me,
  I do not want to exploit
  his or her lack of boundaries.
  Instead, I want to express appreciation
  and work out an equitable way of interacting.

* I keep examining my conscience with true candor.
  I take searching inventories
  not only about how I may have harmed others,
  but also about how I may not have activated my potentials
  or shared my gifts,
  how I may still be holding on to prejudices
  or the will to retaliate,
  how I may still not be
  as loving, inclusive, and open
  as I can be.

* I welcome feedback
  that shows me where I am less caring,
  where less tolerant,
  where less open about my real feelings
  than I can be.
  When I am shown up as a pretender
  or called on being mean or inauthentic,
  I am not defensive
  but take it as information
  about what I have to work on.
  I appreciate positive feedback also.

* I am letting go of the need
  to keep up appearances or to project
  a false or overly-impressive self-image.
  Now I want to appear as I am,
  without pretense
  and no matter how unflattering.
  I do not want to use any charms
  of body, word or mind
  to trick or deceive others.
  Being loved for who I am
  has become more important
  – and more interesting –
  than upholding the ever-shaky status
  of my ego.

* I now measure my success
  by how much steadfast love I have,
  not by how much I have in the bank,
  how much I achieve in business,
  how much status I have attained,
  or how much power I have over others.
  The central
  – and most exhilarating –
  focus of my life
  is to show all my love
  in the style that is uniquely mine,
  in every way I can,
  here and now,
  always and everywhere,
  no one excluded.

* As I say yes
  to the reality of who I am,
  with pride in my gifts
  and unabashed awareness of my limits,
  I notice that I can love myself
  and that I become more lovable too.

* I never give up on believing
  that everyone has an innate goodness
  and that being open
  can contribute to bringing it out.

* I am learning to trust others
  when the record shows they can be trusted
  while I, nonetheless,
  commit myself to being trustworthy
  regardless of what others may do.
  I am always open to rebuilding trust
  when it has been broken,
  if the other person is willing.
